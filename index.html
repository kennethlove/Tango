<p>Because building a content-driven web sites with Django should be easy. Because you should be be able to build a Django web site in minutes, and know everything will work.
Because your content management system shouldn't take over your project and force you to build your project around their cms.</p>

<p>Tango is the result of more than six years building content-driven Django sites, including sites for large publications. 
Like Django itself, it is designed to get a lot done, quickly and simply. Whether you just want a blog or your a professional on deadline, 
you need a content manager solves problems, doesn't create new ones, and works with the site *you* want to build.</p>
