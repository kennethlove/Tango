{"name":"Tango","tagline":"Faster, simpler Django content management","body":"### Why Tango?\r\nBecause building content-driven web sites with Django is harder than it has to be. Tango is the result of more than six years building content-driven Django sites, including large publications. Like Django itself, it is designed to get a lot done, quickly and simply. Deadlines don't allow for fighting with the content manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Batteries included\r\nTango includes everything you need for a content site, including news & articles, blogs, photo galleries, video support, contact forms and more. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Is it ready for prime-time?\r\nHonestly, no. Not yet. We're just getting started. Much more is coming soon.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
