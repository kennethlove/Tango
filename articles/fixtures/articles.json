About five years ago I realized I was going to hit a wall. The site was simply becoming too large and unwieldy for one person to maintain, let alone add much of anything new. \r\n\r\nEventually my prediction hit. Hard. For those who don't know what goes into the site, let me tell you, there are literally thousands of files involved. Text. Images. Programming stuff. All of it interlinking, interrelated and interwoven. Add to that the <em>huge</em> backlog of ideas, images and information the community has submitted, and I simply couldn't keep up with everything. Increasingly, one thing became clear: I needed a database. \r\n\r\nThat was the easy part. Figuring out how to implement a database-driven Gretsch Pages was the hard part. Over the past two years I've built, tested, and ultimately discarded at least three different attempts. All of them were simply not going to work, for one reason or another. \r\n\r\nWithout getting too technical about it, a web framework called <a href=\"http://djangoproject.com\">Django</a> proved to be the way to go, allowing me to build a Gretsch Pages that offered features that have long been requested, while making the whole thing easy to manage. And with the name Django, it seemed only fitting. It didn't hurt that the guys that created and maintain Django are some righteous folks, either.\r\n\r\nSo what you are currently looking at represents the largest project &mdash; and the biggest change &mdash; in Gretsch Pages history. While I doubt many of you are interested in Django (the framework, not the guitarist), I do hope you'll enjoy some of the new features, like being able to comment on guitars and amps, list shows, find other Gretsch members on the map and more.\r\n\r\nThe best part is that we've only scratched the surface of what can be done, so if you have an idea for some cool thing, let me know. \r\n\r\nIf something isn't working for you, let me know that, too. \r\n\r\nA lot of people helped get all this ready and tested, to my great thanks and appreciation. You know who you are, so take a bow. Thanks, guys.\r\n\r\nAnd while I'm at it, thanks to everyone on the Gretsch Pages, past and present, for making the past 10 years so cool, and this project so worth it. \r\n\r\nEnjoy.",

        "body": "A couple of neat new things on the site might be easy to overlook. And they're well worth taking a peek at...\r\n\r\nFirst up, comments. One of the primary goals was of the site rebuild was allowing more ways for people to interact and build on the collective knowledge of the community. Comments are a key part of that, and you'll notice that if you're registered and logged in you can now comment on guitars, amplifiers, this blog post and much more.  If there's something you'd <em>like</em> to comment on but can't, let me know!\r\n\r\nSecond, and related, are ratings. As you comment, you can add your ratings to guitars and amps. It's like our own little Harmony Central, only with people who know what they're talking about.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"/members/\">members section</a> is quite expanded, with a map showing all the members, at least the US ones. Hopefully, we'll be able to map members outside the US soon.\r\n\r\nThere's also a <a href=\"/shows/\">member shows section</a>. Here you can post upcoming shows. They'll turn up on a map, too, if they can be found. Let our Gretsch Pages members know when and where you'll be playing!\r\n\r\nAnd on their \"Edit Profile\" page, members can upload a pic of themselves and/or their Gretsch. A slideshow should be coming soon.\r\n\r\nTucked away in the History section you'll find a new Gretsch Timeline, as well as a new <a href=\"/history/memorabilia/\">Gretsch memorabilia section</a>. If you have an old catalog or other bit of Gretsch stuff floating around, feel free to send a nice picture or scan!\r\n\r\nAnd one final item that could be too easily overlooked: <a href=\"/serial-numbers/chart/\">The Serial Number Dating Chart</a>. JackDaniels put a lot of work into compiling this info, and it shows. Fascinating stuff.\r\n\r\nAgain, the whole point of revamping everything was to build a better framework moving forward, so if there's a feature you'd like to see, or even a \"You know what would be cool\" kind of though, <a href=\"/contact/\">make sure to share it</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Much less known is how close he came to bringing his own Gretsch White Tiki guitar to the world.\r\n\r\nIn early 2005 Elliot huddled up with Mike Lewis at Fender and cooked up what could have been his dream Tiki guitar.  In April he released a handful of photos of a prototype White Tiki. \r\n\r\nBased on his signature Jet models, the White Tiki added TV Jones pickups, a \"Stills\" off-white color in lacquer, plenty of gold sparkle binding, a special headstock nameplate and a \"Tiki\" Pickguard.\r\n\r\nIt looked awesome. Elliot said it sounded awesome. The masses said they wanted one.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/media/img/blog-posts/supplementary/ewt1.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of White Tiki\" /> \r\nIt was not to be. In spite of inspiring one of the longest threads in Gretsch Pages history, only one prototype White Tiki is known to exist, and it remains with Elliot.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would have been too expensive to build. Maybe Gretsch felt it was too similar to the White Penguin. Maybe it was a casualty of Elliot ending his association with Gretsch in November 2005. For whatever reason, the Tiki never made it into production and remains one of the great mythical creatures of Gretsch history.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "\"Which Gretsch is right for me?\" It's a common question, and a devilishly difficult one to answer. \r\n\r\nThe short answer? The one you like and can afford. \r\n\r\nThe long answer is a bit more involved, and tends to lead to still more questions...\r\n\r\nThree major factors seem to come into play with every Gretsch purchase &mdash; style, features and price. Making the right decision usually involves weighing and prioritizing all three factors.\r\n\r\n###Style\r\nWith a Gretsch, style can mean a lot of things. Hollowbody vs. solidbody, color, body shape all matter, and many buyers buy a Gretsch guitar based on style alone. But style may be the *least* important factor. If you want a \"cool rockabilly guitar\", a Jet will get you there just as well as a big orange 6120. \r\n\r\nWhat *does* matter is your comfort. Think about weight and size. The 17-inch bodies on Falcons and Country Clubs aren't for everyone.\r\n\r\nAnd while you're pondering style, make a note of any colors you particularly like or don't like. \r\n\r\nIf you want a western style Gretsch but aren't sure about a hollowbody, maybe a Roundup would be right for you. If you don't wan't an orange Gretsch at all, the 6120 is available in quite a few other colors, or you could look at other similar Gretsch guitars such as the Anniversary. Also, don't be blinded by the \"glamour\" Gretsches. While it doesn't get much attention, the base Tennessean is built for the serious player, but is often overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe point is, style is only a rough starting point, and you have options.\r\n\r\n###Features\r\nThe main thing to consider on features is undoubtedly the pickups. Historically, Gretsch has  primarily offered three pickups  &mdash; DeArmond Dynasonics, FilterTrons and HiLoTrons &mdash; each with their own distinct tone that's unlike anything else.\r\n\r\nMany people have argued the Dynasonic is simply the finest single-coil pickup ever made,  and many others have argued the FilterTron is the finest humbucker ever made. While HiLoTrons rarely inspire that kind of devotion, they have a distinct tone all their own and have unquestionably been put to good use by many people. \r\n\r\nBecause each Gretsch pickup has such a unique voice, which pickup you want should be a major consideration. For more on Gretsch pickups, see [http://gretschpages.com/guitars/pickups/](http://gretschpages.com/guitars/pickups/) or search the board.\r\n\r\nOther features to consider should be scale length, whether or not the guitar has a Bigsby and any other factors that are important to you based on your experience. Remember, some of these things can easily be changed, while others can't.\r\n\r\n###Price\r\nAhh, price. Always a factor. If you absolutely positively can't afford to spend more, can't wait to save more money, or don't have some pro-level feature you'd like to have in mind, take a look at the Electromatic line. In just a few short years it's gone from being the bastard child of the Gretsch line to a series of very good, surprisingly affordable guitars.\r\n\r\nBut if you do really really really want the pro-line Gretsch, save up and shop around. Good deals *do* turn up &mdash; as I write this, HiLoTron-equipped Tennesseans are being blown out for $999, which is a stunningly good price. \r\n\r\nPeople who buy one Gretsch have a tendency to buy another &mdash; and another &mdash; so buying smart means saving money in the long run.",

It focuses on the 2005-07 line.\r\n\r\nClubs in the current Fender Musical Instrument Corp (FMIC) model lineup come in two essential versions:\r\n\r\n* **1957-ish**, with Dynasonic single-coils, tone knob circuit, trapeze tailpiece and humpblock fret markers.\r\n* **1958-ish**, with Filtertron double-coils, tone switch circuit, Bigsby and thumbnail fret markers.

Find out how...\r\n\r\n<strong>Warning/disclaimer</strong>\r\nThe information in this article is provided free of charge, in good faith, and on the condition that it will only be used responsibly and entirely at your own risk.\r\n\r\nThe procedures outlined are based on 20 years experience of tweaking guitars, and have been confirmed through consultation with professional luthiers, etc., as good practice.\r\n\r\nHowever, even something as simple as adjusting a pickup may be fraught with danger &ndash; simply dropping a screwdriver can horribly damage the finish on your guitar. It is up to you to proceed carefully and at your own risk, taking note of all the tips, tricks, and warnings where applicable.\r\n\r\n<h2>Guitar set-up and troubleshooting</h2>\r\nSo, you just bought a new guitar and it\u2019s producing unexpected buzzing, and/or has playability problems. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry &ndash; very few guitars ever play perfect straight out of the box. They are made of wood, and there is an old saying around these parts: \u2018Never trust anything made out of wood.\u2019\r\n\r\nWood expands and contracts with heat and cold or changes in humidity, it warps and twists, relaxes or sags over time, it occasionally does completely inexplicable things, just because it feels like it. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not necessarily the manufacturer\u2019s fault. Differences in climate, temperature, the vagaries of shipping &ndash; all can affect the set-up on a guitar. It may be an issue to take up with the shop you bought it from. They really should have checked it thoroughly and performed a set-up on it before letting you buy the thing, but not all of them do, of course!\r\n\r\nBut what if you bought it on the net, or second-hand? You can't easily return it for servicing, and if you don\u2019t have a good luthier or set-up guy in your neighbourhood, who do you turn to?\r\n\r\nNo problem &ndash; your guitar comes with a whole panoply of features that should be able to tweak to get it into shape, and most of these adjustments can be made with nothing more than a screwdriver, a little care, and some patience.\r\n\r\nHowever, first you need to understand what it is you are trying to achieve...\r\n\r\n<h3>What is a good set-up?</h3>\r\nThe term \u2018set-up\u2019 is a catch-all phrase that covers three main areas: playability, tone, and intonation.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Playability:</strong>How easy the guitar is to play? If the strings on your guitar are too high above the fret board, then it will take a lot more force to push them down onto the frets, which makes the guitar more difficult to play. If the strings are too low above the fret board, they may well buzz against the frets when you pluck them. Exactly what the ideal string height is for you depends on your individual finger strength, what string gauge you use, and how hard you play the strings.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the first \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 of set-ups: <em>Every guitar player is different, there is no such thing as the ideal set-up for everyone, only the ideal set-up for you.</em>\r\n\r\nThe playability of your guitar is governed by two parameters - the action (the height of the strings above the frets), and the neck relief (how straight or bowed the neck is, and to what degree it allows free vibration of the strings). We\u2019ll come to the specifics of \u2018how\u2019 later.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tone:</strong> How your guitar sounds. This is affected by two factors. First, <strong>pickup height</strong>: adjust them too far away from the strings and the output of the pickup will be lower, making your guitar sound quieter with less attack and \u2018bite\u2019, and (especially where single coils are concerned) raising the background hum, or \u2018noise floor\u2019 of the pickup; adjust them too close to the strings, and the pickups may magnetically interfere with the vibration of the strings, decreasing sustain, causing bizarre overtones, possibly even pulling the strings out of tune. This also depends partially on the design of the pickups, because single coils behave differently to humbuckers (but we won\u2019t get into that just yet). \r\nThe second factor that affects tone is the <strong>action</strong>. The height of the strings affects tone as well as playability. The higher the action, the more room the strings have to vibrate freely; the lower the action, the more the vibration of the strings will be impeded by the frets, and the more 'fret buzz' you will get. A higher action will therefore give you more output, more sustain, more bass and a cleaner tone - a lower action will result in more fret buzz, less sustain, less bass and less output.\r\n\r\nSo, already we have two interactive and potentially contradictory requirements; playability and tone &ndash;  to get the best tone, logic dictates you set the action high; to get the best playability, logic dictates you set the action low.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the second \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 of set-ups: <em>There is no such thing as the \u2018perfect\u2019 set-up, only the best compromise you can achieve.</em>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Intonation:</strong> How well the guitar plays in tune. There is no short way to explain this - so I won\u2019t! Suffice to say that from a practical point of view the purpose of intonation is to adjust the scale length of each individual string so that it plays an accurate, in tune, octave at the 12th fret. \r\n\r\nIntonation is adjusted at the bridge &mdash; more specifically, the bridge saddles (on those bridges that have \u2018em) &mdash; but may also be affected by: string height, because the further you have to push the strings to fret them, the more you will bend them sharp; neck relief, for much the same reasons; pickup height, because if the magnets are set too close to the strings they may pull them sharp; the freshness of the strings, because strings gradually lose accurate intonation over the course of their life; and your playing technique, because if you hit the strings particularly hard, you may be pulling them sharp.\r\n\r\nDid I already say that everything interacts? (See \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 no. 2)\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nHopefully you will now have a reasonable understanding of the issues involved in the \u2018set-up\u2019 of your guitar.\r\n\r\nWhat you are trying to achieve with a \u2018good\u2019 set-up is a guitar that plays in tune, that plays easily, and sounds clear and loud - OR - and this is really getting to the grist of it - achieves the best possible compromise between all these requirements. \r\nTake some time to focus on what problems you may be having with your guitar: is it hard to play, is the action \u2018stiff\u2019? Does it play in tune all the way up the neck? Is there excessive fret buzz? How do the pickups sound? Do they seem unnaturally weak, or are you hearing unpleasant overtones?\r\n\r\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\r\nFirst of all you need to plan what you are going to do - it is no good charging at the guitar with a screwdriver waving in your wildly flailing hand, randomly tweaking stuff. That\u2019ll get you nowhere.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to consider whether or not the changes you are planning to your set-up are either achievable or desirable, given your particular playing style.\r\n\r\nSo, here are some more things to think about:\r\n\r\n<h3>Playing style</h3>\r\nRemember, you are trying to optimise the set-up on your guitar to suit <em>you</em>. So what kind of music do you play? What are your priorities for a good set-up?</i>\r\n\r\nIf you play very clean-sounding guitar, with the emphasis on rhythm work, you may consider that sacrificing some playability in order to achieve a loud, buzz-free tone is a worthwhile compromise - so you might be willing to consider a higher than average action.\r\n\r\nIf you play very distorted guitar, with the emphasis on shredding solo work, you may feel that a small amount of fret buzz is an acceptable compromise in order to achieve maximum playability - and go for a lower than average action.\r\n\r\nDo you play very hard? Well you will probably need to set the action a touch higher and/or increase the amount of neck relief.\r\n\r\nDo you play with a soft touch? Well you can probably get away with a lower action and/or less neck relief.\r\n\r\nCan you actually hear any fret-buzz through the amplifier? If you can't, it may not be worth worrying about &ndash; especially on an electric guitar.\r\n\r\nDo you use very heavy strings? Heavy strings have a tighter elliptical vibration pattern, so you can probably get away with less neck relief and/or a slightly lower action.\r\n\r\nDo you use very light strings? Light strings have a looser vibration pattern (i.e. they flap more!), so you will probably need a touch more neck relief and/or a slightly higher action.\r\n\r\nWhat sound are you looking to get from your pickups? Maximum output? Less attack and \u2018bite\u2019? More body or \u2018fatness\u2019? More definition and treble response? A softer, more mellow tone?\r\n\r\nWhat you want to get from your guitar will define how you approach setting it up - in the course of this thread I will assume that, like most guitarists, you are aiming to get the best compromise, the \u2018average\u2019 set-up - somewhere in the middle of \u2018the zone'. I will give pointers along the way as to how to achieve variations on the average set-up - if you are looking for something more specialised - but this is only intended to be a \u2018Trouble-Shooter\u2019, to help solve the more obvious and immediate problems encountered with set-ups. Finding your perfect set-up is a lifetime\u2019s journey - and I can\u2019t possibly hope to cover it all here.\r\n\r\n<h3>Tools</h3>\r\nYou will need a few basic tools to proceed with this, so lets make sure you have them...\r\n\r\n<strong>WARNING/DISCLAIMER:</strong> before you go out purchasing tools based on these measurements, please bear in mind that some models may have different truss-rod sizes and some may be in metric rather than imperial, depending on where they were made: so <strong>please</strong>, use your initiative and confirm the size of your truss-rod. Either check with the manufacturer or just measure the damn thing.\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver &ndash; not too big, the screws on guitars tend to be quite small, and you should choose something short: a big, heavy, long screwdriver will be hard to manipulate, and you risk damaging the finish on your guitar if you drop it.</li>\r\n<li>A flat-head screwdriver - ditto for size.</li>\r\n<li>A truss-rod wrench - what type and size will depend on what guitar you have: Gretsches and Gibsons will have a hexagonal nut at the headstock, for most of these a 5/16\u201d nut socket will do. Most Fenders with a \u2018bullet\u2019 truss-rod, or an adjustment made at the headstock end, require a 1/8\u201d allen key. Fenders with a \u2018vintage style\u2019 truss-rod are adjusted at the body end of the neck, with a cross-head screwdriver. You can get tools like  <a href=\"http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Tools/Wrenches/T-Handle_Truss_Rod_Wrenches.html\">this</a> specifically for guitars, although a socket-set will do (bear in mind though, we only want to make <strong>small</strong> adjustments, so choose something you can manipulate easily), allen-key sets are easy to get at most hardware and bicycle shops.</li>\r\n<li>A metal ruler with small graduations like   <a href=\"http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Tools/Measuring_tools/6_Steel_Rule.html\">this</a>. Make sure the graduations run right up to the end, so you can measure string-to-fret distances, and while it is up to you whether you choose metric or imperial, all the measurements in this article will be imperial.</li>\r\n<li>A set of fresh strings. There is no point in attempting to adjust your set-up with old strings, especially where intonation is concerned. Very often, most of the 'problems' you are experiencing will disappear with new strings anyway.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThere are other tools that may be useful, but not necessary for a basic set-up &ndash feeler gauges, digital calipers, straight-edges, etc. It is between you and your wallet if you want to go and buy them, however, I will describe ways of proceeding without them. Only the tools listed above are what I would describe as absolutely \u2018necessary\u2019.\r\n\r\nHopefully you are now fully prepared to proceed:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You understand what parameters are involved in a 'set-up'.</li>\r\n<li>You have thought hard about your playing style and sound.</li>\r\n<li>You know what you want to achieve with your guitar.</li>\r\n<li>You have plan, a list, of what you are going to do.</li>\r\n<li>Tools? Fresh strings? check.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nNow on to the 'how'.\r\n\r\n<h2>How to adjust your set-up</h2>\r\n\r\n<strong>PROBLEM:</strong> Fret buzz\r\n<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Check neck relief and action. Adjust if necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is always a \u2018right way round\u2019 to do things. In this case it is a good idea to check the neck relief first, then see if the action needs adjustment. They do interact, but should always be treated as separate adjustments.\r\n\r\nIt is NOT a good idea to use the truss-rod to tweak the action, or raise the bridge to compensate for a back-bow in the neck!\r\n\r\n<h3>Checking and adjusting neck relief</h3>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fretnotguitarrepair.com/trussrods.htm\">Fret not Guitar Repair</a> has some good, in-depth information on neck relief, including images which explain it better than words. If you don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m trying to explain, check it out!\r\n\r\nNeck relief,  or a forward \u2018bow\u2019 in the neck, simply allows the strings to vibrate freely without too much interference from the frets, which may cause buzzing. You are only aiming for a very slight amount of forward bow. Some people even swear by setting the neck dead straight, although this has never worked for me. What you definitely <em>don\u2019t</em> want to see is backward bow, as this will cause horrible fret-buzz when the strings vibrate against the hump in the middle of the neck.\r\n\r\nWhen checking neck relief, capo at the first fret and hold the high e-string string down at the 13th fret - you are looking for a little gap between the bottom of the string and the top of the 6th fret. Use your free hand to push the string up and down onto the crown of the fret - this will help you to see the gap better.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of doing this, depending on the make of guitar: basically the same method with one simple variation.\r\n\r\nFor Gretsches and Gibsons with a neck joint around the 14th fret, use the method described above. The truss-rod on these guitars only affects the neck between the nut and the body joint, not the fingerboard extension.\r\n\r\nFor Fenders, use the same method, except you hold the string down at the <em>last</em> fret, and check the gap between the string and the top of the 8th fret. This is because the truss-rod on Fenders extends much further &ndash; and this is the method they recommend.\r\n\r\n<h4>How much neck relief should there be?</h4>\r\nA good rough guide is that the gap between the string and the fret should be the thickness of your high e-string for moderate relief or your b-string for more relief. \r\n\r\nWith experience you can learn to judge it pretty accurately by eye, but if you need a reference and don\u2019t want to shell out for feeler gauges, try this DIY method: get an old e-string and cut off a short length of about 1 &frac12;\u201d. If you cut it from the ball-end it will be much easier to manipulate. Slip the end of this precisely machined bit of wire between the string and the fret whilst fretting at the 1st and 13th frets. Does it fit easily? Is there  a lot of room for it to fit between the string and the fret? Does it fit tightly? Does the string grip onto your little piece of wire? Not the most \u2018scientific\u2019 method! But it will at least give you a rough idea of whether you have too much, or not enough neck relief.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a \u2018by the numbers\u2019 approach: For 12\u201d radius necks and light pickers, around .008\u201d would be moderate relief. For 7 &frac14;\u201d (vintage Fender) radius necks and heavy pickers, around .012\u201d will probably be adequate. So, you can see that if you play a set of .010s, judging by the high e-string will get you in the middle of the \u2018zone\u2019, judging by the b-string will put you at the top-end of the \u2018zone\u2019.\r\n\r\nYou can potentially set the relief anywhere between .004\u201d and .014\u201d, depending on your playing style and personal preference - so as long as you stay roughly within those limits, feel free to experiment and see what works for you. I know at least one luthier who suggests making adjustments, \u2018with your ear, not with a ruler.\u2019\r\n\r\n<h4>How to adjust the neck relief</h4>\r\nNeck relief is adjusted with the truss-rod, and adjusting the truss-rod is easy and relatively safe &ndash; as long as you go slowly. On Gretsches and Gibsons, the truss-rod is adjusted with the hex nut under that small plastic plate behind the nut:\r\n\r\nTurn it Clockwise to tighten - which has the effect of straightening the neck (less relief) by counteracting the string tension.\r\n\r\nTurn it Counter-Clockwise to loosen - which has the effect of adding more forward bow (more relief) by allowing the string tension to pull the neck forward more.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"note\">NOTE - Clockwise or counter-clockwise as seen from the headstock, looking towards the body.</span>\r\n\r\nMake adjustments in small increments. Imagine a clock-face and adjust it 1 hour at a time.\r\n\r\nAfter each adjustment, assess the neck and see what effect it has had. Usually very small adjustments are enough. Don't adjust it more than half a turn in one session, a quarter turn would be considered a big adjustment.\r\n\r\nIf the truss-rod won't move, or feels very tight. <strong>don't force it.</strong>\r\n\r\nIt may be that you have tightened the truss-rod as far as it will go, and there is still too much forward bow in the neck - however, if this happens, it is really important that you don't try and force the truss-rod, because it may shear - and you <em>really</em> don't want a broken truss-rod! \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if your guitar has a rather stiff neck, you may find that even after you have loosened the truss-rod all the way off, there is still not enough tension in the strings to pull the neck forward. You can try changing string gauge - heavier strings will pull the neck forward more, lighter strings, less. BUT, like it probably says on your medication: 'If symptoms persist, consult a Doctor'.\r\n\r\nUse your common sense when adjusting the truss-rod. Make small adjustments and check the relief as you go. If the truss-rod seems too tight, or too loose, take it to a luthier for advice and counseling.\r\n\r\n<h4>Checking and adjusting the action</h4>\r\nWhen you are happy that the neck relief is set properly, measure the action (the distance between the crown of the fret and the bottom of the string), at the 12th fret,  without fretting the string. It is easy to do this with a ruler, as long as it has flat ends and graduations that go right up to the end.\r\n\r\nThe ideal action be on your guitar will depend on your playing style, but here are some rough figures &ndash; factory specs, if you like &ndash; that will give you the \u2018average\u2019 action.\r\n\r\nFor Gretsches with 12\u201d radius necks, Gibsons with 10\u201d radius necks and all similarly appointed guitars - 3/64\u201d for the high e-string, 5/64\" for the low e-string.\r\n\r\nFor Fenders with a 7 1/4\u201d vintage fingerboard radius, and anything up to 9 1/2\u201d radius necks - 4/64\" for the high e-string, 5/64\" for the low e-string.\r\n\r\nIf a set-up by these figures doesn't seem to suit your playing style, it is all very simple: Lowering the action will give you easier playability, but increased possibility of fret-buzz; raising the action will decrease the possibility of fret-buzz, but make for a 'stiffer' playing action.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to have realistic expectations of what can be achieved, so remember what I said at the beginning about everything being a compromise. You can set the action as low as you like, so long as you are prepared to put up with a little more fret-buzz. For a cleaner tone, you can set the action as high as you like, so long as you don\u2019t mind the guitar being slightly harder to play.\r\n\r\nSearching around for the perfect \u2018happy medium\u2019 to suit your individual playing style takes a long time and much experimentation - so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t hit the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 first time, just try and try again. If setting your guitar up 'by the numbers' doesn't work for you, make the adjustments 'with your ear' - and with your fingers, in this case - 'not with a ruler'.\r\n\r\n<h3>How to adjust the action</h3>\r\nCouldn\u2019t be simpler... on all guitars, the action is adjusted at the BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nGretsch and Gibson type bridges are adjusted by the two thumb-wheels at either end of the bridge - clockwise = down, counter-clockwise = up - you will probably need to loosen the strings to do this easily, unless you use extra-light girlie strings. For very fine tweaking, some adjustment (by filing) of the saddle slots may be necessary.\r\n\r\nFender type bridges are adjusted at the individual bridge saddles, in most cases with a very small allen key that should have come with your guitar - when tweaking Strat bridge saddles, make sure the saddle sits straight and is not tipped at an angle. This is OK for vintage Tele bridges, though - where two strings share a single saddle.\r\n\r\nTweaking the action on your guitar is one of the easiest and most fool-proof ways of personalising your set-up - as it is virtually impossible to break the guitar like this, and everything can easily be restored to the original settings, so long as you keep a note of all relevant dimensions.\r\n\r\nUse the measurements listed above as your starting point - they will get you in the ballpark of the 'average' set-up, which should provide a good compromise between tone and playability for most players. See how they suit you, and experiment accordingly - just remember that setting-up a guitar is a balancing act: if you raise the action, for example, the strings will have more room to vibrate, and as a result may actually buzz more unless you increase the neck-relief to compensate; and vice versa, if you lower the action; and so-on and so-forth.\r\n\r\n<h2>Adjusting the Pickups</h2>\r\n<strong>PROBLEM:</strong> Unsatisfying tone.\r\n<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Adjust pickup height and/or pole pieces.\r\n\r\nAdjusting pickups is one of the more fun ways for guitarists to spend hours and hours making almost imperceptible nano-tweaks to pole pieces, then playing their guitar with an intense expression on their face, wondering if the guitar actually sounds any better... hey, we\u2019ve all done it!\r\n\r\nThe exact method for getting the best out of your pickups depends a lot on what type of pickup you have, and what you want to get out of it. I\u2019m not going to go into much detail here, because there are too many different types of pickups and it would take me forever.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some basic \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 that we can go over:\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, bringing the pickup closer to the strings increases the volume and output of the guitar - however, more output does not always mean \u2018better tone\u2019.\r\n\r\nThere are two parts to a pickup: the pole pieces, which are magnetised to pick up the vibrations of the strings, and the bobbin, around which is wound the coil that transforms those vibrations into electrical energy - to put it very simply!\r\n\r\nThere are also two types of pole piece: poles that are \u2018magnetised\u2019 by being threaded through a magnetic plate - characteristically these tend to be screw-headed, i.e., Filtertrons, P-90s, Gibson PAFs and similar humbuckers have at least one row of this type of pole piece - and pole pieces that are themselves magnets, usually referred to as \u2018slug magnets\u2019, i.e., Dynasonics, Fender single coils, and the \u2018other\u2019 bobbin in Gibson PAFs and most humbuckers.\r\n\r\nSo, with most pickup types there are potentially two different adjustments you can make:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Raising or lowering the body of the pickup. In nearly every case, raising the body of the pickup will increase overall output, bass response, and give you punchier dynamics and \u2018attack\u2019. Lowering it will have the opposite effect.</li>\r\n<li>Raising or lowering the pole pieces. In nearly all cases, raising the pole pieces will give you a brighter tone, better string definition (depending on how you set them), and slightly higher output. Lowering them will have the opposite effect.</li>\r\n<li>The important exception to this is Fender type single coils, which have fixed position (sometimes staggered...) \u2018slug\u2019 magnets. In this case, you are effectively raising or lowering both the body of the pickup and the pole pieces - which makes adjusting Fender pickups a rather interesting balancing act.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nTo complicate matters, almost every different pickup type uses a different system for adjustment. Sometimes even &ndash; as in the case of P-90s &ndash; different systems within the same pickup type!\r\n\r\nSo, for the moment, let us just imagine a \u2018pickup for all seasons\u2019 &ndash; a pickup that magically combines the properties of all the main pickup types &ndash; and look very generally at some of the principles of adjustment:\r\n\r\n<strong>PROBLEM:</strong> weak-sounding pickups, with poor bass response. \r\n<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> raise the whole body of the pickup closer to the strings. Raising the whole body of the pickup will give you more \u2018punch\u2019 and output.\r\n\r\n<strong>PROBLEM:</strong> dull-sounding pickups, with no sparkle and poor string definition.\r\n<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> raise the pole pieces and adjust to balance the output of each string.\r\nRaising the pole pieces will give you a brighter tone, and enable you to emphasise individual strings as needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>PROBLEM:</strong> pickups are very loud and/or too muddy.\r\n<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> lower the whole body of the pickup. Lowering the whole body of the pickup will lower the output and \u2018clean up\u2019 the dynamic response.\r\n\r\n<strong>PROBLEM:</strong> harsh-sounding pickups, with unpleasant overtones on some strings.\r\n<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> lower the pole pieces. Lowering the pole pieces will \u2018mellow\u2019 the tone of the pickup, and reduce magnetic interference with the strings which can create \u2018wolf-tones\u2019, \u2018stratitis\u2019, or other strange overtones.\r\n\r\nObviously some adjustments will require a combination of tweaking the overall pickup height <em>and</em> the individual pole pieces. If you are keen to experiment, try both separately, then both together, and see what effect each type of adjustment has. Somewhere in the middle will be the \u2018sweet-spot\u2019, just waiting for you to discover it.\r\n\r\n<h3>How to adjust the pickups</h3>\r\nThis varies enormously with pickup type - so for the sake of economy, I have grouped them according to adjustment methodology, rather than by manufacturer or any other categorisation.\r\n\r\n<h4>Gibson PAFs and similar humbuckers.</h4>\r\nI\u2019m sorry if it seems sacreligous to start with Gibson PAFs, but it is simply because they are the easiest to adjust and explain!\r\n\r\nGibson style humbuckers are <em>incredibly</em> easy to adjust:\r\n\r\nAdjust the overall height of the pickup using the two small screws on either side of the pickup surround. Gibson suggest 1/16\u201d from the string for the treble side, 3/32\u201d for the bass side, as a starting point. When measuring distances from string to pickup, fret the strings at the last fret. This will help to balance out the neck and bridge pickups. \r\n\r\nUse the Gibson recommended height as your starting point, then adjust by ear. You can balance the treble and bass response of the pickup by raising or lowering each side of the pickup.\r\n\r\nAdjust the pole pieces with a flat head screwdriver. It is best to set the overall tonal balance with the pickup height adjustment screws, and then use the pole pieces to adjust the individual string-to-string balance. You can raise them as much as sounds good to you, but it is not a good idea to let them touch the strings. I would leave at least 1-2 mm clearance.\r\n\r\nPickups adjustments are incredibly personal, and depend largely on what sort of music you play. You may need to accept a compromise if, for example, you switch between very clean and very distorted sounds - it is difficult to set up a pickup for both equally: for very distorted sounds raising the pickup for maximum output may be desirable; for sweet clean sounds, lowering the pickup for a smoother, more natural tone may be preferable. A lot of experimentation may be required to find the perfect balance for your playing style - so take your time, don\u2019t expect to get it done in one session, and remember to test your tweaks out live or in the rehearsal studio at gigging volume.\r\n\r\n<h3>Filtertrons.</h3>\r\nFiltertrons get their own section, because, despite being outwardly similar to other humbuckers, there are two important differences: They do not have pickup height adjustment screws, and they do have a double row of pole pieces.\r\n\r\nFirst, some advice from TV Jones:\r\n<blockquote>If you want a Growl in the bridge position adjust the pickup as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the pickup cover to the bottom of both E strings, 5/32\" \r\n\r\nFor a full neck pickup tone: \r\n\r\nFrom the top of the pickup cover to the bottom of the low E, 3/16\", and 7/32\" on the high E side.... No strings depressed. Just a quick measurement to get you in the ballpark.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat a class act! Of course, these measurements refer specifically to his TVJ Classics, but they should be good ball-park figures for most Filtertron types.\r\n\r\n<h4>How to adjust Filtertrons:</h4>\r\nThe two screws on either side of the pickup are not height adjustment screws, they actually fix the pickup onto the parallel bracing under the top - so if you loosen them, all that will happen is that the pickup will fall off! You can raise the height of Filtertrons by shimming them. First use some 'lo-tack' masking tape to fix the bridge base and bigsby to the guitar top and secure the bigsby arm, remembering that TOM bridges are not actually fixed to the bridge base, so remove it carefully. What you don't want to do is remove the strings, forget about the TOM, and have it fall off and damage your finish. \r\n\r\nUnscrew the pickups from the top of the guitar and pull them out <em>gently</em>. It is a good idea to use a soft cloth to protect the finish of your guitar. You will be able to see the screw holes where the pickup rests on the parallel bracing, either side of the pickup cavity - to raise the pickup, all you need to do is pack something (i.e. a \u2018shim\u2019) between the bracing and the pickup. Mouse pad foam seems to be the most popular choice - although a piece of wood, or even card, would do at a pinch. \r\n\r\nLowering the pickup is more tricky, and involves carving into the bracing - so unless you have some experience in this area, it\u2019s probably best left to a professional.\r\n\r\nAdjust the pole pieces with a flat head screwdriver. On Filtertrons you have two rows of pole pieces to play around with, which enables some extremely precise tone-tailoring: raising the pole pieces on the bridge side of the pickup will give you a brighter, snappier tone. Raising the pole pieces on the neck side of the pickup will give you a warmer, twangier tone. The consensus is that raising just one set of pole pieces per pickup and leaving the other set low will give you a much clearer tone,  you just have to decide which half to raise. You can raise them as much as sounds good to you, but it is not a good idea to let them touch the strings - I would leave at least 1-2 mm clearance.\r\n\r\n<h3>Dynasonics and Dogear P-90s</h3>\r\nThese are obviously different pickups, but have one thing in common &ndash; they do not have pickup height adjustment screws, and so need to be shimmed, just like Filtertrons.\r\n\r\nWhy would you want to raise them? Well, like I said before: raising the pickup body increases output and \u2018fatness\u2019, raising the pole pieces increases brightness, but not necessarily volume. With Dynasonics the problem is exacerpated by the amount of magnetism generated by the huge \u2018slug magnet\u2019 pole pieces - which may interfere with the strings and actually result in a <em>reduction</em> in output! \r\n\r\nP-90s are more forgiving, because the pole pieces are less magnetic, but still, raising them does not really add more output, just brightness, and a common problem with dogear equipped guitars is that the bridge pickup is often set too low, resulting in less output in that position. Raising the pole pieces will not really help.\r\n\r\nWith both these types of pickup, the consensus seems to be: raising the body of the pickup, while keeping the pole pieces low, results in a better (louder, fatter) tone.\r\n\r\nFinding spacers for these pickups is sometimes difficult, but not impossible. AllParts stocks P-90 spacer sets, and they are a reasonably common item (just use Google). Dynasonic spacer sets are a bit more specialised, but Blackrider Guitars (one of the board sponsors) usually stocks them.\r\n\r\nShimming them is just a case of unscrewing the pickup (again, carefully, and taking care to protect the finish on your guitar), fitting the spacer underneath the pickup, and replacing it. You may need to split the spacer to thread the wires through.\r\n\r\nDynasonics - from the strings to the top of the pickup cover, aim for around 3/16\u201d for the bridge pickup, 1/4\u201d for the neck.\r\n\r\nDogear P-90s - from the strings to the top of the pickup cover, aim for around 3/32\u201d for the bridge pickup, 4/32\u201d for the neck. \r\n\r\nRemember, these measurements are only ball-park figures, not gospel! Use your ears and experiment to find what suits you. If you can only find \u2018your\u2019 tone by breaking the rules, then do so. When measuring distances from string to pickup, fret the strings at the last fret - this will help to balance out the neck and bridge pickups.\r\n\r\nOn Dynasonics the pole pieces are adjusted by the little screws in the top of the pickup, one next to each pole piece - on P-90s, the pole pieces <em>are</em> the little screws in the top of the pickup. With the pole pieces on both these pickups, sometimes less (lower) is more, especially with Dynasonics. Here is a diagram courtesy of board member Paul Setzer, showing you how to balance Dynasonic pole pieces;\r\n<img src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h51/malbarclay/polepieceadjustmentcopy.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nP-90 pole pieces can be raised as much as sounds good to you, but it is not a good idea to let them touch the strings - I would leave at least 1-2 mm clearance.\r\n\r\nSoapbar P-90s: \r\nIf you are lucky enough to own a guitar with these fine pickups on - it couldn\u2019t be easier!\r\n\r\nThere are two screws in the top of the pickup for adjusting height - you can set P-90s as close to the strings as sounds good to you (I\u2019ve never had any problems setting them really close) but be careful &ndash; if you go too high there is a possibility that the adjustment screws will fall out of their threads in the pickup cavity, and they are extremely fiddly to get back in!\r\n\r\nFollow the tips above on adjusting Dogear P-90s - they are the same, tonally.\r\n\r\nFender single coils:\r\nHuge amounts of internet ether has been wasted discussing Strat pickup adjustment, to no conclusive end. This is because there is <em>always</em> a compromise involved in adjusting Fender single coils: they have pickup height adjustment screws, but the individual pole pieces are not adjustable - and to make things worse, they are powerful slug magnets, like Dynasonics, so they have some of the same problems <i>vis-a-vis</i> raising them too close to the strings.\r\n\r\nSo, raising the pickup will give you more output and body, but because the pole pieces are also being raised, also a much brighter tone - get too close, of course, and they will affect the strings magnetically, resulting in a harsh sound, unpleasant overtones and \u2018stratitis\u2019.\r\n\r\nSo, what to do? Well, here are the Fender recommended adjustments:\r\n\r\n1. Texas Specials: 8/64\" bass side, 6/64\" treble side\r\n2. Vintage style: 6/64\" bass side, 5/64\" treble side\r\n3. Noiseless Series: 8/64\" bass side, 6/64\" treble side\r\n4. Standard Single-Coil: 5/64\" bass side, 4/64\" treble side\r\n5. Humbuckers: 4/64\" bass side, 4/64\" treble side\r\n6. Lace Sensors: As close as desired (allowing for string vibration)\r\n\r\nThese figures should be a good starting point - although personally I think they set the pickups a touch too high &ndash;  but then, I\u2019ve always been prepared to sacrifice a bit of output for a smoother, woodier tone, and that might not necessarily suit you.\r\n\r\nUse your ears, and go with whatever works best for you. Just remember, there is <em>always</em> a compromise necessary with these pickups, you just have to find the best compromise for your playing style.\r\n\r\nFender pickups are adjusted with the two screws on either side of the pickup, or three screws, in the case of Tele bridge pickups - it is pretty self-evident how they work. It is best to start with all the pickups low, then raise the bridge pickup until you get the tone you want, then move onto the middle pickup, and leave the neck pickup until last - this will help you to balance the output between them. A useful tip is that the bridge pickup can be set the highest,  as it does not magnetically affect the strings so much , while the neck pickup should be set the lowest  because it tends to magnetically affect the strings the most.\r\n\r\nIf you are anything like me, you will probably spend the rest of your life tweaking the pickups on your guitars. The tone you get from your pickups depends on string gauge, string type and playing style, as much as it does on how you set them up. How you want them to sound will depend on what amp you use, what effects you use, and what style of music you play. So, it is a constantly evolving process - what I have outlined here is just a basic guide, your most important guide is your ears.\r\n\r\n<h2>Intonation and tuning problems</h2>\r\n\r\n<strong>Problem:</strong> Guitar does not play in tune.\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> Check intonation, adjust if necessary.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the physics of intonation requires a good knowledge of Pythagoras\u2019s theories on the harmonic series, compromises involved in the tempered scale, and how harmonics originate from the mathematical ability through fourier decomposition of any periodic signal into sine waves with frequencies integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Or something...\r\n\r\nAnyway, from a practical point of view all you need to know is that intonation adjusts the scale length of each individual string so that it plays a perfectly in-tune octave note at the 12th fret. This should ensure that your guitar plays in tune all the way up the neck, and chords sound in-tune across all 6 strings, all the way up the neck.\r\n\r\n<h3>How to adjust intonation</h3>\r\n\r\nBefore starting, it is <em>really</em> important to have fresh strings on your guitar. Old strings lose accurate intonation, and there is no point compensating your guitar for worn-out strings.\r\n\r\nTune up your guitar &ndash; it is probably best to use an electronic tuner, unless you have perfect pitch &ndash; and check the harmonic at the 12th fret against the fretted note at the 12th fret for each string. They should be the same.\r\n\r\nThe harmonic is played by lightly touching the string directly above the 12th fret and plucking it.\r\n\r\nIf they are not the same, you need to adjust the scale length of the string to compensate. The harmonic will stay the same, the fretted note is what we want to change.\r\n\r\nIf the fretted note is <b>sharp</b> compared to the harmonic, make the string longer by adjusting the bridge saddle backwards.\r\n\r\nIf the fretted note is <b>flat</b> compared to the harmonic, make the string shorter by adjusting the bridge saddle forwards.\r\n\r\nKeep tweaking the string length until the 12th fret harmonic and the fretted note are the same. Quite small adjustments may have a big effect, so go slowly, carefully  and patiently. \r\n\r\nTune-o-matic and Melita Bridges: \r\nBoth these types of bridges have individual string saddles which may be adjusted backwards or forwards according to need. Tune-o-matics have a screw for each saddle, usually in the front of the bridge (some versions have them in the back...), which moves the saddle as you turn it - Melitas have a small grub screw for each saddle, which you loosen to move the saddle, then re-tighten when the intonation is set.\r\n\r\nStrat and Tele Bridges: \r\nFender string saddles are adjusted individually using the screws in the back of the bridge, which move the saddle backwards and forwards. Strats have individual saddles for each string, so no problems there. Teles with \u2018vintage\u2019 style bridges have two strings per saddle, so you will need to find the best compromise for both strings, although you can buy compensated saddles with the correct angle.\r\n\r\nBar Bridges, Space Control Bridges, Aluminum Bigsby Bridges, and Wooden Bridges:\r\nAll these bridges have two things in common: they do not have adjustable saddles, and they are normally \u2018floating\u2019 bridges.\r\n\r\nBigsby bridges have some built-in compensation, most wooden bridges are also compensated (usually for a wound third) however Bar bridges and Space Control bridges are not compensated, so you will have to search for the best compromise you can get.\r\n\r\nTo intonate a floating bridge, you need to move the whole bridge from the base. The best approach is to intonate the high and low e-strings as accurately as possible by wiggling each side of the bridge forwards or backwards, and then hope that the other strings fall into line!\r\n\r\nSome compromises and a bit of experimentation may be necessary to get the best intonation out of these bridges.\r\n\r\nDue to compromises in the tempered scale and the way guitars are designed, it is impossible to achieve 100 percent perfect intonation. So, it is important to have realistic expectations of what can be achieved. Some people with perfect pitch never get used to these compromises, in which case the only option is the \u2018Buzz Feiten\u2019 system, which uses a compensated nut and special tuning system to get more accurate intonation.\r\n\r\n<h3>Staying in tune</h3>\r\n\r\n<strong>Problem:</strong> Guitar does not STAY in tune.\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> Check nut slots, stringing technique, stretch-out new strings.\r\n\r\nIf your guitar won't stay in tune, check the following:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the strings are locked around the machine heads in the approved manner, just like <a href=\"http://www.uncletim.com/setup.htm\">this</a>. Two wraps seems to be the magic number.\r\n2. Make sure the strings are properly seated on the Bigsby string posts, and tightly wrapped around the bar. Remember to pre-bend the ball end when replacing strings on a Bigsby, so they wrap around super-tight.\r\n3. Stretch out new strings while you are changing them. Tune to pitch and simply pull up the string about an inch, do this all along the length of the string between the bridge and the nut and repeat until you achieve tuning stability (probably 2 to 3 times will be enough) . Notice the first couple of times you do this, the note will go flat as the 'slack' is stretched out of the string.\r\n4. Make sure the strings are not binding at the nut or bridge saddles, use a bit of lubricant, or get the nut re-cut, if necessary. Strings sticking at the nut are responsible for 90% of all tuning problems, it happens when you bend, or Bigsby the strings and a 'sticky' nut prevents them returning to pitch. This happens particularly if you change up to a heavier gauge than the 'standard' strings your guitar came set up with.\r\n5. Think, could I go up a string gauge? Heavier strings stay in tune better; 10s or above on 25.5\" scale guitars, 11s or above on 24.6\" scale guitars would be my personal suggestion. Of course, you can use lighter strings if you want, just don't come here bitchin' about how your set of 08s won't stay in tune when you waggle the Bigsby on your 6120!\r\n6. Bigsbys were originally designed for 'vibrato', i.e. a 'flutter' of about a semitone up and down. They were also designed at a time when 12s were considered 'medium' gauge strings! - and indeed they stay in tune much better with heavier strings. The key to getting tuning stability from a Bigsby is subtlety, a gentle touch is needed (it is not a Floyd Rose!), 'dive-bombs' of more than a tone will get you in trouble, tuning-wise.\r\n\r\nStrat Tremolos:\r\nThese are notoriously difficult to set up right, either 'floating' or flat on the body, however there are some 'secret' Strat users tips that might help.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem with Strat tremolos, is that there is quite a lot of side-to-side movement compared to a Bigsby, because the screws don't hold the trem tight onto the body, the trem pivots on them, balanced by the strings and the springs, so it never returns to quite the same place every time. This is the most important factor in tuning stability with these particular beasts, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThere are two things you can do to balance the trem:\r\n\r\n1. Balance the springs - if you are using three springs, run the two outside springs from the outside edge of the trem block, to the two 'inside' claws next to the middle spring, in a 'V' shape. If you are using 11s, and want the trem to rest flat on the body, you could probably use four springs, in which case, use the outside holes in the trem block and the corresponding claws, leaving the middle one free. This will help control any lateral movement of the bridge.\r\n2. Set the 6 pivot screws like this: The <strong>two outside screws</strong> should be almost flat on the tremolo base-plate. The best way to judge this properly is to take off the strings and springs, allowing the trem to rest flat on the body, then tighten each of the two outside screws in turn until the back of the trem raises off the body, then loosen them off a touch until it rests flat again. the <strong>four middle screws</strong> should be raised ever so slightly, so there is a tiny gap between the screw-head and the base-plate, about the thickness of a couple of sheets of paper. This reduces friction by stopping the trem binding against the screw heads, so it will return to it's original position better. Don't worry, it won't fall off like this.\r\n\r\nRemember that no 'vintage' design whammy system will ever play 100 percent in tune,  particularly compared to a Floyd Rose or other modern designs, so it is important to have realistic expectations of what can be achieved. Bear in mind that those of us who love these antiquated pieces of technology simply accept the limitations and get along just fine, regardless of the odd note going sharp. \r\n\r\n<h3>The myth of bad tuners</h3>\r\nI'm not going to tell you how to spend your money, but I will advise you not to waste it; in my experience very few tuning problems are down to the tuners. Tuners either work, or they don't. If they are genuinely broken, it is usually obvious. Small tuning problems as a result of bending strings, etc., are nearly always down to sticking at the nut, and I would advise you to address this before spending money on replacement parts. If you really feel you need to change tuners, any reasonable quality 16:1 ratio branded tuners will do the job.\r\n\r\nSo, good luck, and remember this: playing out of tune never did John Lee Hooker any harm!\r\n\r\n<h2>What next?</h2>\r\nSetting up a guitar really well takes a lot of experience,  so it is not necessarily something you will be able to get right first time. There is nothing wrong with a bit of trial and error in the initial stages. As long as you go slowly and patiently, making small, progressive adjustments, there is very little you can do to that isn't easily reversible and correctable. Here are some tips to help you along:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have a good idea of what you are trying to achieve. \r\n2. Address each problem individually and as a separate adjustment. \r\n3. Don't try and get it all done in one day.\r\n4. Make a note of everything you do and all relevant measurements, so you can 'undo' any mistakes.\r\n5. Find someone, a luthier or even just a more experienced friend, who can give you 'technical support' when you need it.\r\n6. If you feel like you are just making things worse, STOP!\r\n7. Don't panic!\r\n\r\nThe important thing is not to give up: <em>any</em> guitar can be made to play properly, you may just need to find a good technician who can optimise your guitar and make sure the nut slots are the correct width for your gauge of strings, etc. It is really worthwhile finding a reputable luthier, even if you have to drive a bit further to get there. A good setup can make all the difference! ",

Some are made in Korea and some in Japan. Which ones are good? Which one will suit you?\r\n\r\nIf we've heard it once here, we've heard it a thousand times: which Gretsch should I get? We can help answer that. We really can.  \r\n\r\n<em>Note that the following information places new Gretsch instruments in their historical context, but is meant to help new Gretsch shoppers pick out new guitars from the current (or recent) lines. While some of the basic information about pickups and features transfers, this is <b>not</b> intended as a vintage buying guide.</em>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let me start with a scene from Joe Versus the Volcano.</h3> \r\n\r\nJoe believes he has a terminal illness, and he's taken on a noble mission to save a small island society by sacrificing himself to their volcano. First he has to get to the island, and a rich benefactor is paying his expenses and sending him in style. He's being chauffeured in a Rolls Royce. A regal black gentleman, Marshall, is his driver.\r\n\r\nPretend you are Joe, the volcano is the great force of life, the island is your concert hall and its people are your fans. Clothes are the Gretsch you must pick, Joe's journey is your Gretsch quest, and Marshall is the GDP.\r\n\r\nHere's the scene.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMARSHALL:  Where would you like to go, sir?<br />\r\nJOE: I thought I might like to do some shopping.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Okay.  Where would you like to go shopping?<br />\r\nJOE: I don't know.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMarshall is aggravated, but hides it behind his reserve.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMARSHALL: Alright.<br />\r\nJOE: Where would you go shopping?<br />\r\nMARSHALL: For what?  What do you need?<br />\r\nJOE: Clothes.<br>\r\nMARSHALL: What kind of clothes?  What is your taste?<br />\r\nJOE: I don't exactly know.<br />\r\n</blockquote>\r\nMarshall pulls the car over and stops.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nJOE: Why'd you stop?<br />\r\nMARSHALL: I'm just hired to drive the car, mister. I'm not here to tell you who you are.<br />\r\nJOE: I didn't ask you to tell me who I am.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: You were hinting around about clothes.  It happens that clothes are very important to me, Mister...<br />\r\nJOE: Banks.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Banks.  Clothes make the man. I believe that. You say to me you wanna go shopping, you wanna buy clothes, but you don't know what kind.  You leave that hanging in the air, like I'm going to fill in the blank. That to me is like asking me who you are, and I don't know who you are, I don't wanna know.  It's taken me my whole life to find out who I am and I'm tired now,  you hear what I'm sayin'? What's your name?<br />\r\nJOE: Joe.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: My name's Marshall, how you do?<br />\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThey shake hands quite seriously.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMARSHALL: Wait a minute.  I'm coming back.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nMarshall gets out of the driver's seat, goes back and gets in next to Joe.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMARSHALL: Now what's your situation? Explain your situation to me?<br />\r\nJOE: I'm going away on a long trip.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Okay.<br />\r\nJOE: I've got the opportunity to buy some clothes today.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Yes.<br />\r\nJOE: Money's no object.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Good.  Where you going?<br />\r\nJOE: Well. I'm going out tonight in the city.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Nice places?<br />\r\nJOE: I hope so.  Then tomorrow I'm flying to L.A.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: First class?<br />\r\nJOE: Yeah.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Good.<br />\r\nJOE: Then I'm getting on a yacht and sailing to the South Pacific.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Hawaii?<br />\r\nJOE: No. A really unknown little  island.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: No tourists?<br />\r\nJOE: I don't think so.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: Good.<br />\r\nJOE: Then I'll be on the island for a couple of weeks, then that's it.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: And what do you got in the way of clothes now?<br />\r\nJOE: Well, I've got the kind of clothes I'm wearin'.<br />\r\nMARSHALL: So you've got no clothes. We'll start with basics. We'll start with underwear. We'll start with Dunhill.<br />\r\n</blockquote>\r\nDo you see what's going on here? Joe knows he needs clothes, but he doesn't know what clothes, and he doesn't even know where to go shopping. He doesn't even know his own taste.\r\n\r\nMarshall is a bit exasperated, because clothes are something he's given a lot of thought to. If he's to take on the tiring (if rewarding) job of helping Joe discover who he is, he has to know a lot more about Joe's situation. He has to ask Joe a lot of questions, because Joe isn't very forthcoming.  \r\n\r\n<h4>And that's our predicament here.</h4> \r\nIf you just ask \"What Gretsch should I buy,\" and tell us little else, we're apt to get little testy, because you're asking us to reach through the anonymous ether of the internet, lay our hands on your forehead, and read your mind.\r\n\r\nThe more you can tell us about your situation &ndash; what your experience is, what other guitar(s) you have, the kind of sound you're looking for, guitarists whose tone you like, types of music you want to play, the progress of your search so far &ndash;  the more likely you are to get good information from us.\r\n\r\nIf you've gone to the trouble to come and read the Common Questions forum, you're probably not the guy this topic is meant for, but before you ask <em>any</em>thing, you might consider this a starting point.  \r\n\r\n<h3>Profile of the The Gretsch Quester</h3>\r\nMany Gretsch neophytes are inspired by a particular artist or sound, and they at least <em>think</em> they want a particular model. They may or may not be aware that many models are available with different pickups, and there are more differences among Gretsch pickups than among those offered by many other makers.\r\n\r\nOr they're inspired by a certain \"look\" &ndash; maybe a big orange guitar, a big white guitar, a big single-cut hollow-body, a big brown double-cut, a sleek little single-cut solidbody &ndash; but don't know much else about it.\r\n\r\nSome just know they've wanted a Gretsch since they were kids, and now it's time. Or someone has recommended a Gretsch: \"you sound like you oughta be playing a Gretsch.\"\r\n\r\nThere have even been new buyers who just wake up one day with the mystical certainty they're meant to be Gretsch players, but have no clue beyond that.\r\n\r\nA few &ndash; a very few &ndash; seem to know exactly what they want, and why, and have only detailed questions about differences among models.\r\n\r\nBut no matter which category you fall in, the method of discovery outlined below will help you get where you want to be.  \r\n \r\n<h3>Part One: What Kind of Quester Are You?</h3>\r\n<h4> Gretschs look cool, and I want to look cool. </h4>\r\nNo problem! You can buy a guitar for this reason and none other. We don't care how well you play or don't play, and neither does the guitar. \r\n\r\nIf you're buying just for the classic appearance of a guitar that says \"Gretsch\" on the headstock  (usually a big hollowbody), get the one that looks just the way you like. Gretsch is fresh out of the business of making lousy guitars, Japanese and Korean versions are both well-built and handsome, and whatever you buy will be a nice axe. In case you change your mind later, be assured that (assuming you buy smart), Gretschs hold their value better than many other guitars.\r\n\r\n<h4>Gretschs are really premium, prestigious, iconic guitars with lots of image mojo, and I'm all about that. </h4>\r\nSo ok, same like the version above. Get the one that you think has the most mojorific image.\r\n\r\n<h4> I'm a [Chet/Duane/George/Setzer/Neil/Pete/Byrds/Animals/Bo/Billy/Chris/Rev whomever] fan, and I want a guitar that looks and sounds just like theirs. </h4>\r\nGreat. Our work is nearly done, as each of these plays primarily one version of one model. If you're buying for a special connection with a particular artist, get the model the artist plays. That way your hero picks your guitar for you - and after all, he's the expert in sounding like himself.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a player or a hobbyist, you'll get something to be proud of. They're all nice guitars, you'll be happy, and you need not concern yourself with technical details.\r\n\r\n<h4> I don't know what I want, but I want that Great Gretsch Sound. </h4>\r\nAlright, now we're to the meat of the matter. The number one feature that separates Gretsch guitars from lowly ordinary guitars &ndash; and Gretsch models from each other &ndash; is the pickups. Each of the three types is at the heart of a Great Gretsch Sound &ndash; all classic and distinctively, unmistakably Gretsch. And each has been associated with particular guitars, artists, and genres. You may find just one flavor that lights you up; you may find all three essential.\r\n\r\nSay hi to the Dynasonic single-coil, Filtertron dual-coil (yeah, humbucker), and Hilotron single-coil. \r\n\r\nIf you're after a Gretsch for its tone, this is where you start, and where you should focus a lot of attention. First, listen to artists using each of the three. You might dig around using the search feature of the GDP to find sound samples some of us have posted.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the opportunity to play all three types, though it's not completely necessary &ndash; more than one of us has ordered a guitar based on what we learned and heard here and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOnce you've picked the sound you're after, then consider secondary feaures like body type, scale length, appointments, etc. (Note: If you know you have a hankerin' for a specific body - a 16\" singlecut, a 17\" doublecut Gent, a Falcon, a Jet, etc - then you can start your search for pickups within that model line.)  \r\n \r\n<h3>Part Two: Gretsch Pickups in Words</h3>\r\n\r\n So. What about the pickups? \r\n\r\n<b>Dynasonic.</b> Made originally by DeArmond, installed on all Gretsch electrics starting in 1953, if not earlier. Top-mount single coil with adjustable pole-pieces. Full-sounding, with a fat low end and crisp but rarely ice-picky highs. Great for 50s-60s rockabilly and roots rock, jazz, any country, contemporary alt rock, fingerpicking. Responsive, sensitive to dynamics of attack, and extremely adjustable via tone and volume controls. Articulate, smooth, authoritative. \r\n\r\nCode words: twang, karrranggg, knock, punch, bite. Think mid-50s Chet Atkins, Duane Eddy, Cliff Gallup &ndash; but useful far beyond those guys' genres. Dynasonics are the original Gretsch signature sound, most notably installed in 54-57 Chet Atkins 6120 models (also called Nashvilles), original Country Clubs and Falcons, and Jets.\r\n\r\n<b>Filtertron.</b> Developed by Ray Butts with and for Chet Atkins; introduced mid-1957 and used on most models through the early-mid 60s. If Dynasonics are among the fattest single coils going (along with P90s), then Filtertrons are among the brightest dual-coil hum-\"filtering\" pickups. Two smaller bobbins than Gibson's hum\"buckers,\" which were introduced at the same time. Filtertrons mount on the bracing rails inside the guitar, rather than in mounting rings like Gibson buckers; pickup rings are only decorative. The pickups are also a different size and shape than Gibson buckers OR Dynasonics. More complex midrange tones than Gibson, with a tighter, lighter low end and more details in the highs. Lower output than Gibson buckers, which translates to humbucking without being muddy. Articulation, detail and texture retained under distortion.\r\n\r\nSound code words: sparkle, chime, sweet, ring, smooth, rich, dimension. Think late 50s-60s Chet, Brian Setzer, Who's Next, 1962-63 George Harrison, British invasion, Neil Young & Steve Stills. Also far more versatile than that list suggests, and applicable to anything you might want to play. Most famously installed in 6120 Nashville models from mid-1957 onward, 6122 Country Gentlemen (also called Country Classics), Jets, and Falcons. (Note that Filtertrons are a family, including Gretsch's \"High-Sensitive\" model and a range of TV Jones versions. But they all share the family resemblance.)\r\n\r\n<b>HiloTron.</b> Single-coil pickups in a FilterTron-sized housing; introduced ca 1962 and installed in about half of Gretsch's models through the 60s. Unusually low output - resulting in very detailed, possibly delicate tone. Surfy but a bit thinner; more plink than twang, but not in a bad way. Probably not a good jazz pickup, but ideal for mid-60s jangle and similar forms. Hilos distort, but still sound clean - will icepick at sufficient volume. Very even across all registers, almost \"hi-fi\" balanced in response. \r\n\r\nCode words: jangle, shimmer, clean clean clean. Think the intro to \"House of the Rising Sun,\" 64-66 Harrison, \"8 Miles High.\" Most famously installed in the Tennessean (now called Tennessee Rose). When used with flatwounds, much more body, excellent detail and note definition.\r\n\r\nOther Gretsch pickups you might run across:\r\n<b>DeArmond 2000.</b> Single-coil top-mount pickups used in the Electromatic 5125-5129 series. See Dynasonic description above, and subtract 10%. The 2000 can be thought of as \"Dyna Lite,\" as it has that basic character. With eq, it can be juiced up to sound as close to Dyna as most guys couldn't tell the difference. But it's a fine pickup with its own character in its own right.\r\n\r\n<b>Gretsch Mini-Humbucker.</b> Top-mount \"TV-Jones designed\" small-footprint mini-bucker, as used in Electromatic Pro Jets and Double Jets. Not as fat (or muddy) as a humbucker, not as bright as a Filtertron. Medium output. It has a fine balance of lows, mids, and highs - not heavy in any range. Think \"smooth.\" Unmistakable Gretsch character - but not quite the sparkle of Filtertrons. Like the 2000, it stands as its own thing and is quite versatile. For some it's an entr\u00e9 to Great Gretsch Sound and they go on to other pickups; for others it's fine as is.\r\n\r\n<b>Gretsch Humbucker.</b> Sometimes called the Dumbucker in these parts. Used on various Korean models, including the 5120. This is the mini-humbucker's big brother. It's bigger and warmer than the mini in every way, with some corresponding decrease in relative high end \u2013 but it retains enough Gretsch character that you'll know you're not playing generic humbuckers. You might think of it as halfway between Gretsch and Gibson.\r\n\r\n<h4>Gretsch Pickups ranked roughly from thin/bright to warm/fat.</h4>\r\n\u2022 Hilotron.\r\n\u2022 DeArmond 2000.\r\n\u2022 Dynasonic.\r\n\u2022 TV Jones Magnatron. (A humbucker that sounds very Dyna-like...)\r\n\u2022 Filtertron, High-Sensitive &  TV Jones versions.\r\n\u2022 Gretsch Mini-Humbucker.\r\n\u2022 Gretsch Humbucker.\r\n\r\n*Remember,* all Gretsch pups are not the same size and shape, and only one (the Dumbucker) is exactly the dimensions of a standard humbucker. They also don't all mount in rings like standard humbuckers.\r\n\r\nHilotrons and Filtertrons fit the same size & shape hole, and mount similarly. 2000s, Dynasonics, and the Mini-Humbucker are surface-mount, and are roughly the same size and shape.\r\n\r\nSwaps among the types are possible with some minor tweaking, and both TV Jones and other aftermarket builders (notably Guitar Fetish/GFS) make pickups of all the types which can be fitted to most any Gretsch, regardless what it came with.\r\n\r\nIt's just not as easy as swapping humbuckers. Information about doing these conversions is elsewhere on the GDP.  \r\n \r\n<h3>Part Three: Everything Else</h3>\r\n<h4>OK, I have the pickups sussed and I know what sound I want &ndash; now what about all the other stuff? </h4>\r\nAfter body style and pickups, most of the other features don't matter much &ndash; some because they really just don't matter much, and others because they can very easily be changed later without doing violence to your new guitar. \r\n\r\n(Yes, some features that are technically or musically irrelevant may be important to you because you like them. In that case, you already know more than Joe did and you've got a punch-list started. Good!)\r\n\r\n<h4>Features that matter most.</h4> \r\nAfter pickups (the biggy) here they are:\r\n*Scale length.* Some Gretschs are 24.6\" (similar to most Gibsons); some are 25.5\" (similar to most Fenders). You may be more comfortable with one over the other; you may find a slight difference in tone and feel between them. If you do, then watch for scale length when choosing a Gretsch. It can't be changed later. If scale doesn't matter to you (and it neither should nor shouldn't), then it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\n*Body size.* Hollow-body Gretschs come in depths from 2\" to 2.75\", and in widths from 14\" to 17\". You can rarely get an otherwise identical model in two different sizes, so it's hard to tell how much depth contributes to tone. Size DOES matter somewhat to tone, though, and it definitely affects playing comfort. If you think you'll have an issue with one size or another, best to check the suspects out in person.\r\n\r\nAs a very rough way to guesstimate how \"big\" a Gretsch will sound in comparison to other Gretschs, you can multiply the body depth by the body size. All other factors being equal, the bigger the answer, the bigger and more \"open\" \u2013 the more *hollowbody* the guitar will sound.\r\n\r\n*Trestle or conventional bracing.* This applies to hollow-bodies. Most Gretschs have parallel braces running lengthwise under the tops as well as a narrow \"tone post\" between top and back under the bridge. This is \"conventional\" in Gretsch parlance.\r\n\r\nA few (Setzer models and a new 6120-59) have trestle bracing, which consists of two fairly heavy u-shaped braces between top and back. Trestle-braced guitars are more rigid, which means they sustain a little better and are theoretically less susceptible to feedback caused by body resonance. They also have less acoustic response, and are quieter when played unamplified. They're Gretsch's version of Gibson semi-hollows with a plank down the middle, and have similar performance characteristics.\r\n\r\nA very few (some Country Club models) have spruce tops and no tone post. (Everything else has maple tops.) These are the most acoustically live and resonant guitars in the line, and are somewhat more susceptible to feedback.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, these bracing differences are subtle. But they ARE structural, and while tone posts can be removed or added with modest difficulty and extreme care, trestle bracing is forever. So if bracing matters to you, pay attention when you're buying.  \r\n \r\n<h4>Stuff that can't easily be changed, but doesn't matter much.</h4>\r\n*True f-hole vs simulated (fake, painted-on) f-hole.* Some models have one, some have the other. Closed bodies have a little tighter sound (they're also thinner guitars) and a bit more feedback resistance. And they look different. I accept the configuration that comes with the guitar I want &ndash; this feature isn't make or break for me - but I mention it here because it's obviously hard to change later. (Note: hollowbody feedback on any model can be dealt with in a number of ways. Don't worry much about it unless you're a VERY loud player.)\r\n\r\n*Neck joint.* The necks on most Gretsches join the body at the 18th fret. A few 60s reissues join at the 14th, arguably making access to upper frets more problematic. For most fans of these guitars, this isn't an issue. If you like the guitar otherwise, ignore this. You can learn to deal with it.\r\n\r\n*Tone switch or tone pot circuitry.* A Gretsch with a tone pot has a tone knob just like every other guitar you've played. The tone SWITCH looks like an extra pickup-selector. Its three positions switch between wide open (no tone control in circuit) and two different capacitor values which cut highs to varying degrees. This is also called the \"mud switch\" by those who don't like it.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice there's less difference between playing the two types than it might appear, but some players vastly prefer one over the other. Technically, it's not insurmountable to change a guitar from tone-switch to tone-pot circuitry, but you might have to drill a hole in a tone-pot guitar to install a tone switch.\r\n\r\n<h4>Features that make a difference but can be easily changed later:</h4>\r\n*Bridges: Synchro-Sonic (Melita), Rocking Bar, (aluminum) Bigsby Compensated, Space Control Roller, Adjusta-Matic.* Bridges make a difference in tone and playability, and (arguably) in accurate intonation. But don't choose or reject a model based on what bridge it has, because bridges can VERY easily be swapped. You can obsess about your bridge later.\r\n\r\n*Tailpiece, Bigsby or otherwise.* Just don't buy a Gretsch without a Bigsby. But if you do (and I have), you can add a Bigsby. Later you can switch back. There are four different Bigsby handles as well, but they can easily be swapped, so no problem there either.\r\n\r\n*Tuners: Sta-Tite, Grover Rotomatic, Grover Imperial, Sperzel locking.* They all work perfectly well; they can be swapped for each other if you insist. (Small holes might be left in the back of the headstock.)  \r\n \r\n<h4>Features that make a small difference</h4>\r\nThese features are so unimportant  &ndash; or are so entirely a matter of taste &ndash; that they may be left out of your consideration entirely. (Unless you have firm and immovable opinions about them already.) If a model you want otherwise has a feature from this list, you'd be silly to discount the guitar because of it. If you're looking specifically for any of these features when choosing a guitar, you must be a collector and this article isn't meant for you.\r\n\r\n*Zero fret.* Zero difference.\r\n\r\n*Fingerboard material.* Gretsch generally puts rosewood with Dynasonic single-coils and ebony with Filtertron humbuckers. It's a good match. (Fingerboard material MIGHT make a tonal difference, but it's probably not a feature worth choosing or rejecting a guitar over.)\r\n\r\n*Inlay types.*\r\n\r\n*Binding.* It's pretty, unless you don't think it is. But it's irrelevant.\r\n\r\n*Mutes.* They're useless and ugly, and you won't use them. But they don't hurt anything.\r\n\r\n*Standby (\"kill\") switch.* It's useless except for that stutter thing, but it doesn't hurt anything if you don't use it. It does make a place to put some other kind of control later, should you want to.\r\n\r\n*Back pad.* In order to protect the finish on the back of the guitar, a genuine simulation leatherette-oid vinyl pad is bolted to the back. With trailer-park gold piping. Silly? You bet. But it doesn't hurt a thing, and you'd be fool to pass up a guitar because of it.  \r\n \r\n<h4>Appearance features are a matter of taste.</h4>\r\nDon't ask us if Falcon regalia or Western trim are appropriate for you, or if fake f-holes aren't just the cheesiest thing. We all have opinions, and they're meaningless.\r\n\r\n<h4>OK! Now go shopping,</h4> \r\nAnd come back later to ask detailed questions.",

        "body": "My G6118 double anniversary came with the stock Sta-Tite tuners.  These tuners look great (IMO) but they weren't staying in tune very well with Bigsby usage.  I also wanted the easy re-stringing that comes with locking tuners.  I did not want to make any permanent mods to my guitar.  I came up with a way to modify the stock Sta-Tite tuners to use the locking shafts from some replacement locking Klusons for a Les Paul.  The result looks great and works great.  \r\n\r\nThe only negative is the price:  the locking Klusons are about $80, which is more expensive than the Sperzel or Gotoh locking tuners.  \r\n\r\nOK, the locking Klusons can be obtained from Allparts, <a href=\"http://www.allparts.com/categories.php?cat_id=529&cat_name=LOCKING%203%20x%203%20TUNING%20KEYS\">part number TK_0735-001</a>.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/106/313404587_916a299042.jpg?v=0\" />\r\nHere is a pic of one of the locking Klusons:\r\n\r\nYou can see the locking shaft that we will be removing.  These are closed back tuners, so we will have to remove the back to get at the gear and shaft.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/108/313404589_4d89d6b74c.jpg?v=0\" />\r\nHere is a pic so you can see the locking mechanism. As you can see, the shaft is two parts that are threaded together like a nut and bolt.  The string goes through the female section at the end, and the tension from the string keeps this part from turning.  As the tuning key is tightened, the male part of the shaft is tightened against the string. \r\n\r\n Once the pieces are screwed together tightly the whole assembly will turn to bring the string up to  pitch.  The slot in the top of the female section is so you can unscrew the parts if you break a string.  You can use a guitar pick, coin, or screwdriver.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/120/313404590_c35ff719bd.jpg?v=0\" />I removed the back of the case using pliers, a hammer and a small chisel.  This is actually pretty difficult.  You have to get aggressive with this part to get it off.  I have a vice, which makes the job easier.  We're only using the shaft and gear from the tuner, so you can destroy the casing and the tuner plate.  Here is a pic with the back of the casing removed.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to remove the small screw that holds the gear on.  This is the trickiest part of the whole operation.  The screw strips very easily, and its so small that once it's stripped you can't find a screw extractor small enough to get it out.  I learned this the hard way after stripping two screws and then ruining the shafts trying to extract the stripped screws.  So use the proper sized screwdriver and go slow.  Luckily, Allparts let me order two replacement tuners instead of having to order the whole set.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/105/313404592_36a3be8763.jpg?v=0\" />\r\nHere is a comparison pic with the locking shaft and the stock shaft.  Note that the gears mate to the shafts differently.  The gears are NOT interchangeable.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to remove the screw holding the existing Sta-Tite's gear on.  You do not have to remove the tuner from the guitar to do this.  Just unscrew the screw, slide the shaft out towards the front of the guitar, then take the gear off.  These screws don't strip out near as easily as the ones in the locking shafts, but you still might want to be careful.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/105/313404594_27193b160b.jpg?v=0\" />\r\nTo put the locking shaft in place, first put the gear in place, then insert the shaft from the front.  Replace the screw and you're all finished.  I actually bought some upgraded little screws from the local hardware store that shouldn't strip out as easily.  Here are 2 last pics showing the front and back of the headstock.  Five of the tuners in the pics have been replaced with the locking shafts, and the high E tuner is still the stock Sta-Tite.  Notice that the appearance is very close to stock.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/103/313404595_66b9eb57ff.jpg?v=0\" />\r\nI actually did this mod about 6 months ago, so I've put the locking tuners through their paces.  They really work great.  To me this mod was totally worth it, and it was worth the extra money so I didn't have to modify my guitar and I keep the stock look.",

        "body": "<b>Just what do Gretsch's model numbers mean?</b> A lot, but not very logically.\r\n\r\nSomeone suggested a chart to decode the numbers and letters would be helpful. Accordingly, I undertook to generate one. I learned a lot. None of it will do me any good in later life, should I ever decide what to be when I grow up.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the Gretsch model numbers goes a long way toward understanding what features a modern-era Gretsch possesses, once you can decode the code.\r\n\r\n###A first step of &quot;disambiguation.&quot;\r\nThough it looks like Grestch makes a hundred models, the pro line really consists of about 5 - 7 basic guitars depending on how you count. There are:  \r\n\r\n\u2022 16&quot; single-cutaway hollowbodies (6118, 6119, 6120) - in various body depths, with various pickups, and differing in detail   \r\n\u2022 17&quot; single-cutaway hollowbodies  (6122, 6136, 6192-93-96) - again with variations in pickups and detail  \r\n\u2022 17&quot; thinline double-cutaway hollowbodies  (other 6122s and a 6136)  \r\n\u2022 13.25&quot; thinline chambered &quot;solidbodies&quot;  (6121, 6128, 6129, 6131, 6134) - with pickup and detail variation  \r\n\r\nIn addition, there are, or have been, several unique designs don't fit into the overall scheme (or sell in great numbers):\r\n\r\n\u2022 14&quot; thinline hollowbody &quot;Juniors&quot; \r\n\u2022 a 16&quot; double-cut thinline hollowbody (6120DC)   \r\n\u2022 the TV Jones-designed Spectra Sonic chambered thinline guitar &amp; baritone   \r\n\u2022 rectangular Bo Diddley chambered solidbody\r\n\u2022 Billy Bo Jupiter Thunderbird chambered solidbody (Gumby as designed by Salvador Dali.)  \r\n\u2022 Jet six- and twelve-string doubleneck (6128T-6/12)  \r\n\u2022 Nashville doubleneck (6120-6/12)  \r\n  \r\n###Gretsch by the numbers.\r\nLet's dig in. All the model numbers begin with &quot;G.&quot; I've figured out that *that* means **guitar.** Unless it means **Gretsch**.\r\n\r\nWe know that the 4-digit code which follow the &quot;G&quot; generally associates with guitar families. Shall we run those down?\r\n\r\n- 6118: Anniversary  \r\n- 6119: Chet Atkins Tennessee Rose (Tennessean)  \r\n- 6120: Chet Atkins Hollow Body (Nashville)  \r\n- 6121: Chet Atkins Solid Body  \r\n- 6122: Chet Atkins Country Gentleman (Country Classic)  \r\n- 6128, 6129, 6131: Jets of various sorts  \r\n- 6134: Penguin\r\n- 6136, 7593: Falcon\r\n- 6138: Bo Diddley\r\n- 6143 &amp;  6144: Spectra Sonic\r\n- 6192, 6193, 6196: Country Club\r\n- 6199: Billy Bo Jupiter Thunderbird\r\n\r\n* For more model numbers, see the <a href=\"/guitars/\">Guitars section and Gretsch-GEAR database</a>.\r\n\r\nOn modern Gretsches, letters (and occasionally numbers) follow the model designation, and that's where it gets wacky.\r\n\r\nThe numbers are easy - four digits always represent vintage model years a modern guitar emulates, the lone &quot;-12&quot; designates Gretsch's only 12-string, and &quot;6/12&quot; goes for the two doublenecks. \r\n\r\nIt's important to understand that some model numbers are derived from the vintage numbering scheme, in which each model variation was given a unique model number. That's why Country Clubs are 6192, 6193 and 6196, or there is a 7593 White Falcon (that was the model number for the '70s era Falcon that model is based on).\r\n\r\nIn the modern era, Gretsch has gradually moved to denoting model variations with a letters following a common model number. The problem is, the letters are on drugs. Sometimes they represent colors. But the same letters don't always mean the same color, some colors have multiple codes, and only some model numbers include color codes. Sometimes a different color gets its own model number instead of an alpha code.\r\n\r\nSometimes the letters represent an endorser. Sometimes they refer to features such as pickups, tremolo, or finish type. (And in the case of &quot;F&quot; in two Malcolm Young models, they seem to mean nothing at all.)\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that there is &quot;faulty parallelism&quot; in Gretsch's name-and-number scheme. I had intended a simple chart of what each alpha-numeric model name suffix represents, but it turns out there's enough variation that it almost has to be broken down on a model-by-model basis.\r\n\r\nThat turns the codebreaker chart into another version of the catalog. So each model family comes under its own heading, with a short statement of the most inclusive characterization of the family's shared attributes. (IE, a 6120 is a 16&quot; deep hollowbody). Then follow the individual model designations, with the letters highlighted in the descriptive words from which I deduce they are taken...\r\n\r\n<b>Many codes are used only once</b>, but of those used twice or more, a few seem to hold true across the board:  \r\n\r\n**CS** - Custom Shop (though little used)  \r\n**DS** - DynaSonic  \r\n**FT** - FilterTron  \r\n**HT** - HiloTron  \r\n**L** - Lacquer  \r\n**MY** - Malcolm Young  \r\n**SS** - Setzer Signature (or maybe &quot;Special&quot;)    \r\n**T** - Tremolo  \r\n**TV** - TV Jones  \r\n**V** - Vintage  \r\n**W** - Western    \r\n   \r\nRelish minute details? Here we go!\r\n\r\n6120s are usually Chet Atkins Hollow Bodies  (previously Nashvilles). They're all deep 16&quot; single-cuts - except for the DC, which is double-cut and thinline.\r\n* 6120: plain ol' orange Filtertron CA/Nashville    \r\n* AM/BK/BS/TM: color codes as follows:AM - A*mber* M*aple*; BK - B*lac*K; BS - B*lue* S*tain*; TM - T*iger *M*aple*  \r\n* DSV: D*yna* S*onic* V*intage*  \r\n* DSW: D*yna* S*onic* W*estern (trim)*  \r\n* W-1957: W*estern (trim)*, year emulated (based on a '56 modified by Eddie Cochran in 1957 with a neck P90...)  \r\n* -1959: year emulated  \r\n* -1959LTV: year emulated, L*acquer*  TV* (Jones pickups)*  \r\n* DC: D*ouble* C*utaway*\r\n\r\n\r\nSome 6120s are Brian Setzer models. These 16&quot; single-cutaway hollowbodies are based on the Chet Atkins 6120.\r\n\r\n* SSU: S*etzer* S*ig* U*rethane*   \r\n* SSUGR: S*etzer* S*ig* U*rethane* GR*een*  \r\n* SSL: S*etzer* S*ig* L*acquer*  \r\n* SSLVO: S*etzer* S*ig* L*acquer*  V*intage* O*range*    \r\n* SH: S*etzer* S*ig* H*otrod*, in the following colors: BK - *flat* BL*ack;* A - *candy* A*pple red;* B - *regal* B*lue*; T - T*angerine;* P - P*urple*; L - L*imegold*  \r\n* SHxxTV: S*etzer* H*otrod* TV *(Jones pickups)*, xx is color code, as above\r\n   \r\n \r\n6121s are Chet Atkins Solid Bodies, otherwise and occasionally known as Nashville Solid Bodies, Roundups (and orange Jets). All are &quot;thinline&quot; and chambered.\r\n\r\n* -1955: year emulated (Dynas, fixed Bigsby, western kitsch)  \r\n* -1959: year emulated (Filters, no western)\r\n \r\n\r\n6122s are Chet Atkins Country Gentleman models (previously Country Classics). They are 17&quot; hollowbodies, some single-cutaway deepbody and some double-cutaway thinline.\r\n\r\n* -1958: year emulated  \r\n* -1959: &quot;  \r\n* -1962: &quot;  \r\n* II: Carryover from the 90s, when there was actually a single-pickup Country Classic I\r\n* -12: 12-string \r\n\r\n6119s are Chet Atkins Tennesseeans (or, at times, Tennessee Roses). All are 16&quot; single-cut more-or-less thinline hollowbodies.\r\n\r\n* 6119: plain ol' maroogundy Deep Cherry Stain TR  \r\n* -1962FT: year emulated, F*ilter*T*ron*  \r\n* -1962HT: year emulated, H*ilo*T*ron*</blockquote>  \r\n\r\n6136s are Falcons, usually White. Unless it's a DSBK (black w/Dynas), TBK (black w/trem), TSL (black w/silver trim and trem), or SLBP (Setzer Black Phoenix). They are 17&quot; single-cut deep hollowbodies (except the DC, which is double-cut and thinline).\r\n\r\n* DS: D*yna*S*onic*  \r\n* DC: D*ouble* C*utaway*  \r\n* DSBK: D*yna*S*onic*, B*lac*K  \r\n* T: T*remolo*  \r\n* TBK: T*remolo*, B*lac*K  \r\n* TSL: T*remolo*, S*i*L*ver* (actually a black guitar w/silver trim...)  \r\n* SLBP: S*etzer* L*acquer* B*lack* P*hoenix* (also black w/silver trim)  \r\n* 7593: A sort of re-issue of the Baldwin-era 7593 White Falcon that carried over the model number\r\n\r\n6192, 6193, 6196 are Country Clubs... (So why give each color its own number, when in the rest of the line, colors are often letter-designated? Why not 6192SB, 6192AN, 6192CG?) Clubs are always 17&quot; single-cut deep hollowbodies.\r\n* 6192: sunburst  \r\n* 6193: blonde  \r\n* 6196: Cadillac green  \r\n* 6193T: T*remolo*  \r\n* 6196T: T*remolo*</blockquote>  \r\n\r\n6118s are Anniversaries, and always have been. Usually they're two-tone smoke green. (Except when they're not, and then the model number doesn't include a color code. Also, 6117 is an Anniversary of a different color...) All are 16&quot; single-cut deep hollowbodies.\r\n* 6118: plain ol' smoke green Filtertron Annie  \r\n* T: T*remolo*  \r\n* T-120: T*remolo*, 120*th Anniversary* (a yellow guitar with tremolo and TV Jones pickups...)  \r\n* 6117 T-HT: T*remolo*, H*ilo*T*ron* (in sunburst)  \r\n* 6118 TJ-R: T*remolo*, J*unio*R (size)</blockquote>  \r\n\r\n6128s are Duo Jets with black tops, except the CG, which is green. All Jets are small body, thinline, and chambered. Most are single-cut, some double-cut.\r\n\r\n* 6128: plain ol' black Jet, late 50s-style w/Filtertrons  \r\n* T: T*remolo*  \r\n* T-1957: T*remolo*, year emulated (DynaSonics)  \r\n* T-1962: T*remolo*, year emulated (a doublecut)  \r\n* TSP: T*remolo*, SP*ecial* (same as T-1957, but with aged markers and binding and a rocking bar bridge instead of roller. It's the Harrison model Jet, but I guess they couldn't call it a GH...)  \r\n* TCG: T*remolo*, C*adillac* G*reen*  \r\n* T-DSV: T*remolo*, D*yna*S*onic* V*intage* (same basic DynaSonic Jet as T-1957 and TSP, but with fixed-arm non-V tremolo, SynchroSonic bridge, and block markers. It's a '55-56 instead of a '57. Also lacquer, and the most original of the bunch.)  \r\n* TVP: TV *Jones* P*owerTron pickups*  \r\n* T-TVP: T*remolo*, TV *Jones* P*owerTron pickups*\r\n  \r\n\r\n6129s are Sparkle Jets, Duo-Jets in glitter drag.\r\n\r\n* 6129: plain ol' silver sparkle (with Filtertrons and no Bigsby)  \r\n* T: T*remolo*  \r\n* -1957: year emulated (DynaSonics)  \r\n* T-1957: T*remolo*, year emulated  \r\n* T-1962: T*remolo*, year emulated (a doublecut)  \r\n* TAU: T*remolo*, AU *(the chemical symbol for gold)*  \r\n* TG: T*remolo*, G*reen sparkle*  \r\n* TL: T*remolo*, L*ight Blue Pearl*\r\n   \r\n\r\n6131s are Jet Firebirds, Gretschian for &quot;red Jets&quot;\r\n\r\n* 6131 T: T*remolo*  \r\n* 6131 TDS: T*remolo*, D*yna*S*onic*  \r\n* 6131 TVP: TV *Jones* P*owerTron pickups*    \r\n* 6131 T-TVP: T*remolo*, TV *Jones* P*owerTron pickups*</blockquote>   \r\n\r\n6134s? They're Penguins. That's Gretschese for &quot;white Jet with Falcon-style appointments.&quot; \r\n\r\n* 6134: yer basic  \r\n* 6134 B: B*lack*\r\n  \r\n6143 &amp; 6144 Spectra Sonics: Nothing else like them in the line.\r\n\r\n* 6143: 15.75&quot; thinline chambered alder single-cut with laminated spruce top, mahogany neck, and padauk fretboard. 24.75&quot; scale.  \r\n* 6144: same thing, but a baritone at 29.25&quot; scale\r\n  \r\n###And what about those sig models?\r\nWell, some have their own shape and get their very own model numbers (the 6199 Billy-Bo Jupiter Tbird and 6138 rectangular Bo Diddley). But the others are based on regular Gretsch models.\r\n\r\n* 6136 I: I*rish Falcon* (green, Bono pickguard)  \r\n* 6136-1958: year emulated (Stephen Stills model)  \r\n* 6120 DE: D*uane* E*ddy* (officially discontinued, but still in our hearts)  \r\n* 6120 KS: K*eith* S*cott*  \r\n* 6120 RHH: R*everend* H*orton* H*eat*  \r\n* 6131 SMY: S*ingle Filtertron*, M*alcolm* Y*oung* (Malcom Young's personal Jet started out as a 60s double-cut Jet Firebird, hence the 6131 designation)  \r\n* 6131 SMYF: S*ingle Filtertron*, M*alcolm* Y*oung* (F*lame maple*)  \r\n* 6131 SMYR: S*ingle Filtertron*, M*alcolm* Y*oung* , R*ed*  \r\n* 6131 MY: M*alcolm* Y*oung* (two Filtertrons)  \r\n* 6131 MYF: M*alcolm* Y*oung*   \r\n* 6131 MYR: M*alcolm* Y*oung*, R*ed*",

Banjos made up most of their production, and the more ornate models were eventually the inspiration for the opulent outfitting on the White Falcon.\r\n\r\nGretsch also had a steady sideline as a musical wholesaler. Low-priced and mid-priced instruments \u2014everything from ukeleles to band horns \u2014would be made by other manufacturers and then resold with a Gretsch logo on them, or Gretsch would farm out models to be sold under other labels, much as Harmony, Kay and Danelectro later did for Sears' Silvertone label.\r\n\r\nMany of the instruments were made by well-known manufacturers in their own right.  Conn, for example, made many of the band instruments and LaTosca was responsible for most Gretsch accordians. Valco made nearly all of the vintage Gretsch amps and lap steels.\r\n\r\nGretsch also had their own subsidiary line, Bacon, to round out their market range in the '50s. Bacon had made instruments prior to being bought by Gretsch that bore no resemblance to the Brooklyn products, but after the takeover, Bacons were usually thinly-disguised versions of popular Gretsch models.\r\n\r\nLater, in the '70s, a line of low-priced Japanese-made instruments were imported and sold under the Dorado name in an effort to compete with the flood of imports inundating the market. Flattop acoustics and solidbody electrics alike were sold under the Dorado name. None held much in common with Gretsch's own guitars.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "In April of 2010, just weeks before the disastrous flood destroyed much of the surrounding Nashville area, a cache of 500-700 authentic vintage Gretsch guitar bodies was discovered in a warehouse formally owned by the Sho-Bud company.\r\n\r\nSho-Bud was purchased by Gretsch in the mid-1970s. The Corvette and Astro-Jet guitar bodies  were apparently stored\r\nthere undiscovered for decades. In his own words, Mike Armist -- mafiajug on the GDP -- describes\r\nthe circumstances of his find:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nSho-Bud guitars (here in Nashville) had contracted with Gretsch around the\r\nearly 1960's to make some prototype guitars of some experiment that Shot\r\nJackson had. Sadly all involved have passed away. Anyhow, I worked with\r\nCharlie Derrington for a while and he owed me for a job I'd done for him. He was\r\ncontacted about all of these bodies in cleaning out the old warehouse where\r\nthey were stored. I told him I was interested in all of it and we worked out a deal\r\nwhere I cleaned out the area and I could keep the bodies as payment for the job\r\nI'd done for him. I intended on making guitars out of them, and I never did. Jim\r\nTriggs made a few out of them. I think he made one for Aerosmith? I also have\r\na full size refrigerator box full of miscellaneous parts, Brazilian rosewood bridges\r\nfor classical, twelve string and a few six string guitars. Some ebony ones in there\r\ntoo. I also have Brazilian rosewood stairstep bridges for an archtop guitar. Some\r\ncheap tuning gears from that era too. Not sure of the make on those. Some old\r\nSho-Bud steel guitar blanks as well.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMike went on to share that he had subsequently contacted Fred Gretsch to see\r\nif he was interested in acquiring the bodies, but Fred was not. He also reported\r\nreceiving an e-mail from FMIC declining to pursue the bodies for a proposed\r\ncustom shop project.\r\n\r\nNews of this discovery soon found its way to the GDP thanks to loyal Gretsch\r\ndevotee and Nashville Craigslist cruiser Rob (Tartan Phantom), and word\r\ntraveled quickly through the community. It was soon evident that the degree of\r\ninterest was high amongst the more intrepid GDPers who recognized the find as\r\nan opportunity to make their own version of a Gretsch guitar.\r\n\r\nMike soon began communicating to the GDP community, initially pricing the solid mahogany bodies at $100 plus\r\nshipping. Rob was gracious enough to stay involved and act as a go-between for\r\nselecting bodies (on-site) for interested GDPers. As the best bodies were sold\r\noff thru May, some scratch and dent bodies were made available at a reduced\r\ncost ($50), encouraging even more takers within the GDP.\r\n\r\nAs the various GDP member projects got underway, necks were\r\nprocured from a variety of sources until Joe (Jack Daniels) solicited the business and began producing several styles in quantity. Variations offered included mahogany with rosewood or ebony fretboards, in 4x2 or 3x3 tuner configurations, from $225-$250. Neoclassic inlays were also an option for a slight premium. \r\n\r\nPaul Setzer stepped-up to be a source for the requisite\r\npickguard needs for these project guitars, offering a variety of materials, as\r\nwell as accurate templates for both the Corvette and Astro-Jet models. As\r\nfar as acquiring the rest of the components, such as hardware, wiring, and\r\nfinish options\u2026 the GDP community members have been very collaborative\r\nhelping each other to ferret-out sources, as well as conceiving ideas for custom\r\nappointments.\r\n\r\nIn early August Mike announced that he had found a buyer for the remaining\r\nbodies (over 400) and that he would no longer be a source for GDPers, but\r\nwished everyone luck with their projects, and has continued to periodically check\r\nin to monitor the progress of the active participants.\r\n\r\nMid-way into 2011, we are now finally seeing the fruits of the many industrious\r\nand talented GDPers who saw potential in Mike\u2019s discovery, and the finished\r\nguitars of the \u201clong-lost Nashville bodies\u201d have become a reality. \r\n\r\n** Coming soon: the gallery dedicated to these project instruments, and the people who have\r\nbrought them to life.**",

        "body": "We don't redesign lightly or easily here at Gretsch Pages HQ. Full-on redesigns are messy, and usually a bad idea. Things break. Things get lost. The old way turns out to be better. \r\n\r\nAnd yet today we've launched a fully redesigned Gretsch Pages. Why?\r\n\r\nWell, the old design dates back more than five years, with a couple of refreshes along the way. But it's not the age that killed it. The design had held up pretty well, when used for its intended purpose. It's that the web and the world had changed around it.\r\n\r\nPhones. Tablets. E-Readers. We just don't all sit down at our 17\" monitor with a nice, predictable 1024-pixel resolution anymore.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, you simply can't design for a 1024 monitor any more. It doesn't exist anymore (except on an iPad).\r\n\r\nSo it had to work across the dizzying array of devices out there now, and coming soon. It had to address shortcomings, and maybe answer a few small wishes. So here we are...\r\n\r\n* Nearly everything has been re-written under the hood to be faster and more reliable. \r\n* Navigation around the site is vastly improved. It's easier to tell what's going on in other sections, and easier to get there.  \r\n* Almost every section came in for improvements in usability.  \r\n* it is, as far as I know, the world's first full-featured forum that work wells on both mobile.\r\n\r\nMost of the new features are small, and you may not even notice them for awhile: Events keep a running total of giveaways, for example, and when one is open it lights up.\r\n\r\nOther things you should notice right away, like the ability to set your style preference.\r\n\r\nI'd like to give a special thanks to Danman for the gorgeous background photos, and to all the beta testers who poked and prodded at this thing and watched me toss it out and start over at least twice.\r\n\r\nIf you spot a problem, let me know. If you can tell me which browser, the approximate window size, and which page you were on, it is an immense help tracking the problem down.\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me, if you still happen to be on IE6, this isn't going to work out. You'll need to upgrade your browser, or try Chrome Frame, which reinvigorates that old browser like a double-shot of Geritol with a espresso chaser.\r\n\r\nIt's a modern site, and it'll look best on a modern browser. Chrome and Safari do best, followed by Firefox.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it. Forgive us (and notify us of) the occasional rough edge. We're still polishing.",
